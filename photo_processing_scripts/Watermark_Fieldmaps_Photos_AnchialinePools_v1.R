# 1) Navigate to https://nps.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=20b20a767ffb4d608f292f5ba4619208. You may need to log in to nps.maps.arcgis.com.
# 2) Click "Export Data" in the menu on the right, and Select "Export to FGDB".
# 3) Give the file an appropriate title and export to a folder in your content. Click "Export". This may take several minutes.
# 4) Once exported, click "Download" and download the file, saving it in the "geodatabase" folder within this project.
# 5) It will download as a zip file. Extract the file by right clicking and selecting "Extract All". Save the extracted file to the "geodatabase" folder.
# 6) Rename the geodatabase to something like "YYYYMMDD_WQ_PACN_Field_Images.gdb"
# 7) Update the USER INPUT section in this script. 
# 8) Use the Source button above or highlight the whole script and press ctrl-Enter.
# 9) Contact Amanda if you get an error.
