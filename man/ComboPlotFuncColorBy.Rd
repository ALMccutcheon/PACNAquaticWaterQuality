\arguments{
\item{data1}{A dataset in the format of kahocentralnutdata. Must include the fields parameter, year, quarter, year_quarter, mean_value and (for marine only) depth.}

\item{data2}{A dataset in the format of kahocentralysidata. Must include the fields parameter, year, quarter, year_quarter, corrected_mean and (for marine only) depth.}

\item{type}{Resource type. Marine or Non-Marine.}

\item{years}{A list of years to be used as breaks on the graphs. Default is c(2009,2011,2013,2015,2017,2019,2021)}

\item{yearrange}{A list of length two indicating the min and max years displayed on the graph axes. Defaults is set to c(2008,2022).}

\item{graphtitle}{The desired graph title. Default is set to "Water Quality at Selected Park and Resource".}

\item{colorby}{The varaible you'd like to color by station_id or loc_name.}

\item{errorbartype}{The type of error bar. Default is "CI" for 95\% confidence interval. Otherwise it will do Standard Error.}
}
\value{
